## 🔭 What Is the ESP Wallhack?

ESP stands for **Extra Sensory Perception**, and in gaming, it means showing hidden info—like enemy positions, loot, and vehicles—directly on your screen. This **wallhack for Enlisted** renders enemy players, AI, objects, and vehicles through walls, terrain, and buildings in real time.

Whether you're sniping, rushing, or camping an objective, this gives you **permanent map control**.
